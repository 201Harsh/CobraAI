## ‚ö° AI Tutor Example

> Example AI Suggestions

```text
[AI]: Great job! However, using `const` instead of `var` improves scoping and avoids accidental redeclarations.
[AI]: Consider breaking down your function into smaller reusable components for clarity.
[AI]: You forgot to close your `<div>` tag in line 10.
```

## ü§ñ AI Code Review

CobraAI's **AI Code Review** is a dedicated feature and worker pipeline that inspects submitted code and returns structured, actionable feedback. It combines conventional static analysis tools with the power of large language models to produce human-friendly and machine-actionable reviews.

### How AI Code Review Works (Overview)

1. **Submission**: User submits a file, snippet, branch, or repository link for review. Meta-data (language, runtime, test command) is included.
2. **Pre-Processing**: The Code Review Worker runs language-specific linters, formatters, and static analyzers (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Flake8, Bandit, SonarQube rules) to catch straightforward issues.
3. **Automated Tests**: If tests exist or are requested, the worker runs the test suite in an isolated environment (WebContainer or CI runner) and captures failures and traces.
4. **LLM-powered Analysis**: The worker creates a structured prompt including lint results, test failures, code excerpts, and repository metadata and sends it to the LLM (Google Gemini / OpenAI). The LLM performs:
   - Semantic bug detection (logical mistakes, edge cases)
   - Security & dependency issues (insecure patterns, outdated libs)
   - Performance suggestions (complexity hotspots, caching opportunities)
   - Maintainability and style guidance (naming, modularization, documentation)
   - Test suggestions and example test cases
5. **Patch Generation**: For many suggestions the worker can produce a git-style patch or specific code snippets that can be applied automatically or manually.
6. **Explainability**: Each suggestion includes: the _issue_, _severity_, _suggested fix_, _explanation_ (why it matters), and _confidence score_ so users can prioritize changes.
7. **Human-in-the-loop**: Users can accept/modify/reject fixes; maintainers can require manual approval before applying patches to protected branches.
8. **Privacy & Safety**: By default, private repo content is processed in your own backend (never sent to 3rd-party storage) and only the minimal context required is sent to the LLM service. Sensitive tokens and secrets are redacted before review. An audit log records review actions.

### AI Code Review Outputs

- **Inline comments** shown in the editor with line numbers and code excerpts.
- **Structured report** (JSON) that can be used to populate dashboards or integrate with CI.
- **Auto-fix patches** that apply Prettier/ESLint or suggested small edits.
- **Test suggestions & generated tests** to increase coverage.
- **Security advisories** with links to CVE references and recommended dependency upgrades.

### Example Review Flow (User experience)

1. User clicks **Request Code Review** and selects files/branch.
2. Worker runs linters & tests, then sends a consolidated prompt to the LLM.
3. User receives a review summary and can expand inline comments to see full context and auto-fix patch.
4. User applies fixes automatically or copies suggested snippets to their editor.
5. Review history is stored in the DB for future reference and learning statistics.

### How to Configure (Example environment variables)

```
CODE_REVIEW_ENABLED=true
LLM_PROVIDER=google_gemini
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
REDACT_SECRETS=true
ALLOW_AUTO_FIX=false
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Notes (Suggestions & Best Practices)

- Keep the code review worker sandboxed (WebContainer, Docker, or ephemeral CI) to avoid executing untrusted code on production hosts.
- Maintain a whitelist/blacklist of rules and configure severity levels per project.
- Use structured JSON outputs from the worker to integrate with dashboards and GitHub/GitLab check runs.
- Add rate-limits and size caps for repo submissions to prevent abuse and overuse of LLM credits.
- Provide an "explain in plain English" toggle for junior developers to receive simpler explanations.
